At the end of each distinct work item, please make sure to use "git commit" to save and document the changes that you have made.  You should not mark a work item as completed until AFTER it has been succesfully committed.
Please note that for this project fail-fast is a primary goal.  Please do not use mock data to hide failures.  Please do not use generic exception handlers.  Please do not build special case handlers for uninstalled packages.  In these cases, please stop and identify the issue so I can fix the root problem.
Please do not blame the database unless you have confirmed there is an actual database issue. This project is useless if the database is not working, so please do not try to hide failures.  Instead, please let me know there is an issue.
If you need anything, please ask.
Remember: correctness is more important than performance.
It is better to fail-stop than it is to pretend something bad didn't happen.
Please make sure to always test your changes before you tell me they are done.
Please make sure to always test the ablation pipeline to ensure that it still works.
